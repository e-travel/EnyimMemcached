# Enyim Memcached Client (e-travel fork)

This is e-travel's fork of the popular Memcached client. The original client can be found [here] (https://github.com/enyim/EnyimMemcached).

Latest Updates:

* Removed signing. Couldn't get the thing to work otherwise.
* Fixed a bug where setting expiration for particular values resulted in them being immediately purged from Memcached.
